## Install

### Download (recommended)

Download the latest `.app` from [Releases](https://github.com/momenbasel/PureMac/releases), unzip, and drag to `/Applications`.

### Build from source

```bash
# Prerequisites
brew install xcodegen

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/momenbasel/PureMac.git
cd PureMac
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project PureMac.xcodeproj -scheme PureMac -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build build

# Run
open build/Build/Products/Release/PureMac.app

# Or open in Xcode
open PureMac.xcodeproj
```

## Scheduling

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon or Cmd+,)
2. Go to the **Schedule** tab
3. Enable **Automatic Cleaning**
4. Choose your interval: hourly / 3h / 6h / 12h / daily / weekly / biweekly / monthly
5. Optionally enable **Auto-clean after scan** and **Auto-purge purgeable space**

## What Gets Cleaned

| Category | Paths |
|---|---|
| System Junk | `/Library/Caches`, `/Library/Logs`, `/tmp`, `~/Library/Logs` |
| User Cache | `~/Library/Caches`, npm/pip/yarn/pnpm caches |
| Mail Attachments | `~/Library/Mail Downloads` |
| Trash | `~/.Trash` |
| Large Files | `~/Downloads`, `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop` (>100MB or >1yr old) |
| Purgeable | Time Machine local snapshots via `tmutil` |
| Xcode | `DerivedData`, `Archives`, `CoreSimulator/Caches` |
| Homebrew | `~/Library/Caches/Homebrew` |

## Safety

- Never deletes system-critical files
- Only removes caches, logs, temporary files, and user-selected items
- Large & Old Files are **not auto-selected** - you choose what to remove
- All operations are non-destructive to the operating system
- Purgeable space calculation uses only Time Machine snapshots, not total free space
